        If you're reading this, I'm probably recommending you a book! I've
        reflected on my favorite books and articles the past several years, but
        this year (and in years to come) I'm making the top of that list public.
        I wholeheartedly recommend a read of everything I mention here!

        The Code Breaker: Jennifer Doudna, Gene Editing, and the Future of the
        Human Race{' '}
      </Heading3>
      <SubTitle>by Walter Isaacson</SubTitle>

      <Heading4>Why this book is awesome</Heading4>
      <P>
        This book is a deep dive into the nascent gene editing technique of
        CRISPR, the scientists who uncovered the process from the natural world,
        and the ethics of tampering with evolution. It’s extremely well written,
        story driven, and hard to stop thinking about.
      </P>
      <P>
        After reading this book, its clear to me that CRISPR gene editing is
        going to quickly change the world as we know it—this is not hyperbole.
        Jennifer Doudna’s groundbreaking paper on CRISPR was only published in
        2012, and by 2018 the first known children with with CRISPR edited genes
        were born in China.
      </P>
      <P>
        Worth the read for excellent background on the discovery of CRISPR, the
        competitive race to patent gene editing, and the ethics of editing a
        genome. CRISPR gene editing can be done in somatic cells (ex. eye cells,
        liver cells) and germ line cells (ex. stem cells that will become a
        baby). Therapies in somatic cells will cure disease for that single
        patient, but editing done to germ line cells will affect that person and
        all of that person's decedents. What happens to the world when
        artificial changes can only be bought by some and are inherited by their
        bloodline forever? What happens when we play with the delicate balance
        of genetics in our own bodies and the ecosystems of world? No one knows,
        but we’ve definitely turned a corner.
      </P>
      <P>
        Walter Isaacson is an incredible author, and the book is beautifully
        written. He makes a point to stress how easy it is to use CRISPR
        technology, and even has a chapter written about his own experience
        editing cells in a lab. I had some FOMO after reading, so I went and got
        an at home CRISPR kit myself and tried to edit cells in my apartment.{' '}

          It was a big success

        , and I don't think there's anything like in-Manhattan-apartment

      <Heading4>How I found it</Heading4>
      <P>
        I found this book thanks to a conversation I had in 2020 with Ernie
        Parizeau, former VC and adjunct professor of entrepreneurship. I was
        asking him for advice on whether I should leave Google to start a
        company (I didn't leave for another year), and he suggested I read from
        a series of books he’d curated on entrepreneurship, life, and venture
        capital. It's been an awesome resource to me,{' '}

        Liftoff: Elon Musk and the Desperate Early Days That Launched SpaceX
      </Heading3>
      <SubTitle>by Eric Berger</SubTitle>

      <Heading4>Why this book is awesome</Heading4>
      <P>
        SpaceX started as a chaotic scrappy startup just like Google or Amazon,
        but they wanted to make something much more ambitious: reusable orbital
        rockets. It was so ambitious they almost didn’t make it out of infancy,
        and Musk almost went broke. Today, SpaceX has single handedly reclaimed
        US space dominance and transformed the space industry. It’s a wild story
        how they got there.
      </P>
      <P>
        One andidote that stuck out to me: an intern litterally crawled into a
        rocket fuselage to stop it from collapsing during air freight and saved
        the day (and maybe the company). The reason they had the rocket on air
        freight? SpaceX couldn't secure a launch pad in the US, so they had to
        build one near a US military base in the middle of Pacific Ocean.
      </P>
      <P>
        I’m not an Elon fan boy, but it's hard not to respect his ambition after
        reading this story. He took his $200m payout from PayPal and tried to
        build a rocket company from scratch! That amount of money was budgetted
        to fund the launch of 3 rockets, only one of which had to be successful
        for the company to survive (spoiler alert, there’s a ton of explosions
        and it comes down to the wire). This book follows the early engineers at
        SpaceX and their mission to get something into orbit and prove that
        privatized and cheaper space travel was possible.
      </P>
      <P>
        I read this book and thought "damn, I should have been a mechanical
        engineer!" But more than that, I got lost in the excitement of space
        travel, the work of ambitious & talented people, and the chaos of an
        early stage company.
      </P>
      <Heading4>How I found it</Heading4>
      <P>
        I found this book the first week it came out after someone tweeted a
        paragraph. Reading about startups + space, I was hooked. Consider this a
        positive data point on taking random advice from Twitter!

      <Heading3 id="book3">Project Hail Mary: A Novel</Heading3>
      <SubTitle>by Andy Weir</SubTitle>

      <Heading4>Why this book is awesome</Heading4>
      <P>
        The best fiction book I’ve read in a long time. This book finds a way to
        make crazy science seem believable enough for some truly outrageous
        ideas. If you liked reading The Martian by Andy Weir, you’ll love this
        book. It’s the Martian, taken 100 steps further and into deep space.
      </P>
      <P>
        Half of the book revolves around our main character, a biology professor
        on a solo mission in deep space. The other half happens as a series of
        flashbacks on earth. Slowly, it's revealed why a mission to deep space
        was necessary, how that mission would be theoretically possible, and how
        the whole world needs to rally together make it happen. It's an awesome
        page turner, and I think they're making a movie out of it soon.
      </P>
      <Heading4>How I found it</Heading4>
      <P>
        I’d read a ton of non-fiction/startupy books and wanted to turn back
        into fiction. I liked the Martian, and saw that this book had been
        recently released. I think it's incredible science fiction, and was hard
        to put down.

      <Heading4>Lean Startup by Eric Ries</Heading4>
      <P>
        Excellent framework for creative metrics driven startups. Your goal at a
        startup is to test your business model as soon as possible: build, test,
        analyze. Great advice on crafting metrics, how to measure success, and
        when to pivot. Was a great read before starting a company.

      <Heading4>Ready Player One</Heading4>
      <P>
        A distopian future where people escape the apocalyptic real world for
        life inside a VR game. Quick page turner, extremely nerdy (in a good
        way), and more relevant today with the impending ~metaverse~. Spoiler
        alert, the moral of the story is that you have your best experiences in
        the real world, not online.

        <A href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/">The Washington Post</A>, and

          How to waste your career, one comfortable year at a time

      </Heading3>
      <SubTitle>By Apoorva Govind</SubTitle>
      <P>
        This article struck a nerve with me when I was deciding between leaving
        Google or working on OnePager full time. It starts with the question
        “What's the most expensive mistake you've made in your career?”
      </P>
      <P>
        Apoorva claims the answer is complacency. Complacency is a cancer for
        big aspirations and your reputation. But how do you know when you’re
        being complacent and it’s time to make a change? Apoorva asks herself 5
        questions every quarter, requiring a hit rate of 3/5 to continue down
        her current path:

      <P>
        Chris Dixon, entreprenuer and current a16z investor, wrote this article
        in 2009, but I stumbled across it in the fall of 2021. Awesome reasoning
        why it’s best to experiment with various roles and opportunities early
        on in your career. You don’t want to commit too much time to climbing
        the wrong hill in your life and find the peak of that hill isn't as high
        as you thought. It's in our nature to keep trudging forward, but picking
        the right hill is the real challenge.

        Ok this article's insane, had this in my notes as the “mind bending
        article.” It’s an interview with cognitive scientist Donald Hoffman, who
        claims that our perceptions of the world do not truly depict the reality
        we’re living in. It sounds crazy, but it’s worth a read.

        I was grabbed by their discussion of neuroscience and quantum
        physics—two at odds studies that meet in the middle at consciousness.
      </P>
      <Quote>
        On one side you’ll find researchers scratching their chins raw trying to
        understand how a three-pound lump of gray matter obeying nothing more
        than the ordinary laws of physics can give rise to first-person
        conscious experience. This is the aptly named “hard problem.”
      </Quote>
      <Quote>
        On the other side are quantum physicists, marveling at the strange fact
        that quantum systems don’t seem to be definite objects localized in
        space until we come along to observe them — whether we are conscious
        humans or inanimate measuring devices. Experiment after experiment has
        shown — defying common sense — that if we assume that the particles that
        make up ordinary objects have an objective, observer-independent
        existence, we get the wrong answers.
      </Quote>
      <P>
        AKA consciousness in the brain doesn’t make sense to neuroscientists,
        and quantum physics doesn’t make sense without consciousness.
        Interesting thought, and the discussion on reality is mind bending.
